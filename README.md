## How do you run tests?

1. Created test and ran `pytest`
2. Imported formula from series module to test_series module
3. Run `pytest`
4. Fleshed out formula in series module
5. Run `pytest`
   - If failed, tweak check for error and refactor accordingly
      - GOOGLE, PEER, TA
   - If Pass, proceed to next formula.

## Any tests of note?

def parse_template required to use regex. Regex made it INSANELY harder. I needed a lot of hand holding on this on.

def test_read_template_raises_exception_with_bad_path threw me for a quick loop.
